There are two different main page files: index.html and index-set.html. Choose only one to run the application.

There are multiple ways of running this code:
- Double clicking on a index.html file. This method only works with index.html. For index-set.mm run a server.
- Running a server with Node.js using `node server.js` command. Before running this command make sure `npm install` command executed as well. The content will be available with http://localhost:8000 address.
- Running a different server other than Node.js, for example, Python server using `python -m http.server` command.
